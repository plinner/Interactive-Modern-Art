# Interactive-Modern-Art

My goal for this project was to make modern art more accessible, and to integrate touch into the 'viewing' of artwork. The user can touch certain parts of the painting I created in order to activate a program on MakeyMakey which tells the user more about the artwork, the artist, and gives suggestions and prompts which would ideally help the user connect with the painting. I achieved this by using conductive paint, a MakeyMakey kit, and the MakeyMakey programming software 'Scratch'. I was inspired to create this because of class discussions about art galleries, and how they could be imporved. I was intrigued by the idea of making art galleris more accessible to the public. 

When I was trying to come up with an idea for my final project I struggled for many weeks. I could not really come up with a feasible project, and every idea I had either seemed too big, or too small. I finally turned my focus from trying to come up with an innovative new idea, to which technologies I had learned about that I liked, and how I could use those in some way. MakeyMakey was one of the first technologies that we explored in Interactive Exhibit Design, and I was drawn to it because of it's easy to understand functionality, combined with the seemingly limteless application. It was one of the modules in class that I felt comfortable exploring further. I was also drawn to the low tech elements of the class, such as the cardboard creations in the beginning, and the paper portion near the end. After reading though a book on how 'tinkerer's' turn low tech material into interactive creations, I was inspired to do the same with modern art. 

I chose modern art for two main reasons. The first and most important reason was because modern art is often considered the most inaccesible and misunderstood. The second, was because I knew I could re-create a version of some modern art pieces myself, which was crucial for incorporating the conductive paint. I chose to focus on the work of Piet Mondrian, as many of his works involve solid black lines, and boxes of colour. It also fit nicely with one of the main themes in my program which was "is it really art if anyone can do it." My version, in comparison with Mondrian's made it clear that while the painting seemed simple, obviously not anyone could create it like the artsit did. 

After I settled on an idea I spent a lot of time thinking over exactly how I wanted to execute it before I painted anything. I tried to think about how the project could function if it were actually being used in an art gallery, and one thing I wanted was for the project to be elegant and efficient. I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could hide wires, and make the ground for the MakeyMakey blend into the project. I did this in a few ways. First, I applied the black conductive paint at the corners and edges of my painting so that the line ran over the edge, and onto the canvas at the back of the frame. The sections that were at the back are where I attached my wires, which I then hid behind the canvas. For the ground wire, I drilled a hole in a plastic paint palette where a person's thumb would naturally rest, and put a copper fastener through the hole. I wrapped the bottom of the fastener around the ground wire, and made sure I used a long wire so that the user had mobility. I also made sure that hte palette was ambidextrous, so it could be used by anybody. Finally, I created a stand out of scrap cardboard so that the painting would stand on it's own, and the user could touch and explore it without having to lay it down. 

After I created the painting and made sure it worked I began creating the interactive elements. The "scratch" program was extremely easy to use, but it still took time and research to develop my content, explore the program, and figure out how to best execute the interative elements. Because of the simplicity of the program, I decided to take the project down the roado f kids programming 

I did run into some issues throughout the course of developing my project. I discovered that the paint I used for the rest of my painting was slightly conductive, which caused the six seperate interactive sections I had created to be limited to four. This was fine for this project, but in the future I would thoroughly test my paints for conductivity, and ensure I was using compelty seperate brushes for my conductive paint to avoid possible overlap. I also found that the paint itself was sensitive, and responded somewhat erratically when it was touched. I noticed that it only really did this at the end of my project, when some of the paint was starting to wear away under the aligator clips. I also noticed that the finnikyness increaed when I used a conductive paintbrush I fashioned out of copper pipe and conductive paint. One issue that I had with the program was that it did not allow me to get very creative with my content. I did my best, and used mulitple images and talking icons, but if I had time I would have liked to try a more sophisticated programming system. 

Overall I am proud of the work that I did for this project, and the final product. I feel that with some development and time, this could turn into something that I might implement in future museums. This is a project that could be done in a kids program, and it could be applied to a limteless number of artworks.
