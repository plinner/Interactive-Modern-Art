# Interactive-Modern-Art

The Project

My goal for this project was to make modern art more accessible, and to integrate touch into the 'viewing' of artwork. The user can touch certain parts of the painting I created in order to activate a program on MakeyMakey which tells the user more about that piece of art. I did this through the use of conductive paint, a MakeyMakey kit, and the MakeyMakey programming software 'Scratch'. I came up with this idea based on class discussions about art galleries, and how they could be imporved, and because of my own love of art and my desire to share this with the public.
